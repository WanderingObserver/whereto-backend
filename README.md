## Getting Started with WhereTo
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Things you need to install beforehand:
* **MacOS** - This app runs on non-mac machines, but instructions need to be adjusted. 
* **npm** - Javascript package manager. (`pnpm` personally preferred)
* **nodeJs**
* **express** - nodeJs framework.

### Installing
To clone and run this backend server app. Run the following set of instructions.
Open terminal. 

First clone this repo. 
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/WanderingObserver/whereto-backend.git
```
If everything was cloned correctly. Run the following set of instructions. 
```shell
cd whereto-backend

npm i

npm start
```
 This project should now be running locally on port `3005` which can be reached by the url `http://localhost:3005/` on any preferred browser.

### Installing the Front-end
WhereTo consists of a front-end and a back-end. For this project to run you have to have both projects installed and running locally at the same time.

If haven't already, you should now clone and install the front-end of this project; instructions [here](https://github.com/SeeYouSpaceCowboy/yelp-search-reactjs.git).
